		<h1>Volcanic Island</h1>
		<h2>This scene was a test for large scale environments. I started the year by making mountains procedurally with displacement nodes, but that proved to have its drawbacks. For this scene I went to the <u><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Landscape_Modeling_I:_Basic_Terrain" class="main-page-links">Noob to Pro/Landscape Modeling</a></u> tutorial by Wikibooks for manual mountain making.</h2>
		<h2>The main principle demonstrated in this tutorial was proportional editing. Proportional editing is a tool that allows you to manipulate multiple verticies at once based on a mathematical falloff rather than manipulating one vertex at a time. By setting the falloff to a gradual curve, you can manually create smooth peaks from a subdivided plane.</h2>

		<h2>By setting the falloff of the proportional editing tool to random, you can add fine detail to the rocky surface.</h2>

		<h2>Using these tools, a whole bunch of mountains can be created very quickly. I decided that mountains were boring so I turned mine into a volcano. I used proportional editing to carve a hole into the top and then I added a red light source to emulate lava.</h2>
